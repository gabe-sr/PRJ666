## **PSICOWORKING**
---
Psicoworking is a psychological and coworking sharing services business that specializes in providing psychological care and private offices for psychologists and their patients on demand. The company is owned by Nathalia Polla and Priscilla Rego, who manage all the office’s bookings. The office is divided into a shared space that serves as a waiting room for patients, and as individual rooms for the psychologists and patients to meet.

### Overview
---
The Coworking Spaces Booking Platform for Psicoworking aims to automate management logs and introduce a more cohesive method of interaction for clients looking to book a room in the company’s space. 

The project is composed of three main components: a public Main Organization Page, a User Area, and an Administrator area.
- The Main Organization Page is the facade of the business, it contains information about Psicoworking and allows authorized users to log in.
- The user area allows registration for the service, login, time slot and room availability consultation, room reservation, and booking history visualization.
- The Administrator area contains management options, in which an authorized user is able to approve/refuse user registration requests, cancel bookings per user request, and get reports on room usage and user booking history monthly or per request.
